1. Overview
===========

This BSP layer is used to support Intel Snow Ridge product family.

1.1 Dependencies
----------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River Linux, the
wrlinux layer and generic intel-x86 BSP layer.

1.2 Maintenance
---------------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.

1.3 Building the intel-snow-ridge layer
---------------------------------------
This layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This is done automatically
when using the Wind River setup.sh wrapper.

To build the BSP, use "--machine=intel-snow-ridge".

3. Runtime Development Kit (RDK)
================================

Intel Runtime Development Kit (RDK) is enabled through template feature/snowridge-rdk.
Please read ${LAYERDIR}/templates/feature/snowridge-rdk/README first.

4. Notes
========

1) The QAT C4xxx Series can be supported either by feature/snowridge-rdk in
intel-snow-ridge layer or feature/intel-qat in intel-x86 layer.
But you cannot use feature/snowridge-rdk and feature/intel-qat together in one build.
Because they all provide QAT related kernel drivers and this will cause confliction.
