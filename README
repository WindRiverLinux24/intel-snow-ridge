1. Overview
===========

This BSP layer is used to support Intel Snow Ridge product family.

1.1 Dependencies
----------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River Linux, the
wrlinux layer and generic intel-x86 BSP layer.

1.2 Maintenance
---------------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.

1.3 Building the intel-snow-ridge layer
---------------------------------------
This layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This is done automatically
when using the Wind River setup.sh wrapper.

To build the BSP, use "--machine=intel-snow-ridge".

3. Runtime Development Kit (RDK)
================================

Intel Runtime Development Kit (RDK) is enabled through template feature/snowridge-rdk.
Please read ${LAYERDIR}/templates/feature/snowridge-rdk/README first.

4. Notes
========

1) The default serial console port is ttyS4 at MMIO 0x9068b000.
The console index may be different on your board due to different BIOS settings and
different design of hardware.

2) The QAT C4xxx Series can be supported either by feature/snowridge-rdk in
intel-snow-ridge layer or feature/intel-qat in intel-x86 layer.
But you cannot use feature/snowridge-rdk and feature/intel-qat together in one build.
Because they all provide QAT related kernel drivers and this will cause confliction.
