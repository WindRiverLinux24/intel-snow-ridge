snowridge-rdk
=============

1. Building
-----------
The Runtime Development Kit (RDK) is a package of user space and kernel space
libraries and drivers which provides a multi stage packet processing architecture
for wireless applications.

Wind River doesn't provide RDK packages, please contact Intel. RDK tools are not
buildable by default. In order to build it, you need to

1) Copy and rename rdk_klm_src_<branch>_<revision>_<date>_<commit>.tgz to
${LAYERDIR}/recipes-devtools/rdk-tools-snr/files/rdk_klm_src_snr.tgz.

2) Copy and rename rdk_user_src_<branch>_<revision>_<date>_<commit>.tgz to
${LAYERDIR}/recipes-devtools/rdk-tools-snr/files/rdk_user_src_snr.tgz.

3) To enable this feature, please add the following configuration parameter.

    --template=feature/snowridge-rdk

4) Uncomment RDK_TOOLS_SOURCE in feature/snowridge-rdk/template.conf

5) Add the following setting in conf/local.conf.

    CUSTOMER_RECIPES:wr-intel-snow-ridge += "rdk-tools-snr"

2. After installing on target
-----------------------------
The rdk-tools will be installed to three locations.

1) Libraries, header files, binaries and configuration files will be installed
to /opt/intel/rdk-tools on target.

2) Kernel out-of-tree drivers will be installed to
/lib/modules/<kernel version>/kernel/drivers/staging/intel-rdk on target.

3) Firmware in RDK will be installed to /lib/firmware on target.

3. Kernel out-of-tree drivers
-----------------------------
All drivers from Intel RDK tools are disabled from auto-loading. You can use "modprobe"
to load the driver you want, or change "module_conf_<driver>" in rdk-tools-snr.bb.
